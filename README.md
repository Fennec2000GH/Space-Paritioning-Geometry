Space-Paritioning-Geometry 
-------------------------- 

OOP project to be used as a study aide in learning key concepts from computational geometry, especially focused on partitioning hyperspace. This also serves as practice for geometry libraries e.g. CGAL in the future. 

Plans for the Future
--------------------

Implement more auxiliary methods to fetch private info from n-polygons 
Implement neighbor-to-neighbor triangulation traversal for a 2D polygon 
Deipher x- and y- monotone polygons
